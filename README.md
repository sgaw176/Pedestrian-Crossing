Run PedestrianCrossing.py and set the target pedestiran flux(tested up to 2 peds/s) and desired simulation time. While running a constant display of the current simulation time and number of pedestrians should display. At the end of the simulation there will be an animation of the pedestrians movements over time and a heat map of relative traffic throughout the duration of the simulation.
